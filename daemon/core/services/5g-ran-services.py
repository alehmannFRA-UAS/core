    Example Custom CORE Service

    :cvar name: name used as a unique ID for this service and is required, no spaces
    :cvar group: allows you to group services within the GUI under a common name
    :cvar executables: executables this service depends on to function, if executable is
        not on the path, service will not be loaded
    :cvar dependencies: services that this service depends on for startup, tuple of
        service names
    :cvar dirs: directories that this service will create within a node
    :cvar configs: files that this service will generate, without a full path this file
        goes in the node's directory e.g. /tmp/pycore.12345/n1.conf/myfile
    :cvar startup: commands used to start this service, any non-zero exit code will
        cause a failure
    :cvar validate: commands used to validate that a service was started, any non-zero
        exit code will cause a failure
    :cvar validation_mode: validation mode, used to determine startup success.
        NON_BLOCKING    - runs startup commands, and validates success with validation commands
        BLOCKING        - runs startup commands, and validates success with the startup commands themselves
        TIMER           - runs startup commands, and validates success by waiting for "validation_timer" alone
    :cvar validation_timer: time in seconds for a service to wait for validation, before
        determining success in TIMER/NON_BLOCKING modes.
    :cvar validation_period: period in seconds to wait before retrying validation,
        only used in NON_BLOCKING mode
    :cvar shutdown: shutdown commands to stop this service
